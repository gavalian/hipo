# hipo

High Performance Output (HIPO) is a data format for experimental Physics.
It uses chunked data blocks to store data with LZ4 compression. Provides highly 
efficient read speeds. Originally implemented in Java for physics reconstruction
software using service oriented architecture (SOA), now has C++ implementaion 
with wrappers to interface FORTRAN and PTYHON. The wrapper does not provide full 
functionality that exists in C++ and Java libraries.


## Installing the Package

Package has a dependency on LZ4 compression library, which is a submodule.
Use command:

```
 git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:gavalian/hipo.git
```

to clone the distribution. Then compile using 'make', or 'cmake', and start using.

## Usage

The package contains example with code to write and read hipo files. Here are
a few quick examples:

read two banks from a file, and print the content on the screen:

```c++
#include "reader.h"
int main(){
   std::string file = "mydatafile.hipo";
   hipo::reader   r(file);
   hipo::banklist list = r.getBanks({"REC::Particle","REC::Event"});
   int counter = 0;
   while( r.next(list)&&counter<350){ counter++; list[0].show(); list[1].show();}
}
```

Looking into large amount of data frequently require data histogramming for
numerical data quantitive representation. The hipo package includes a simple
(to be improved and extended) histogramming package and a very simple
visualization tool (ascii only) for debugging and exploratory purposes.
Here is an example code to create a histogram and fill it with data from
a bank and display it on the excreen.

```c++
#include "reader.h"
#include "twig.h"
int main(){
   std::string file = "mydatafile.hipo";
   twig::h1d hz(120,-15,5);
   hipo::reader   r(file);
   hipo::banklist list = r.getBanks({"REC::Particle"});
   while( r.next(list)){
      for(int r = 0; r < list[0].getRows(); r++){
         if(list[0].getInt("charge",r)!=0) hz.fill(list[0].getFloat("vz",r));
      }
   }
   hz.print();
}
```

Output:

## Iterators

Iterators can be used to read through bank. There are several ways to construct iterators, through expressions and
through lambda functions. Here is an example with expressions:

```c++
  hipo::reader   r(file);
  hipo::banklist list = r.getBanks({"REC::Particle","REC::Event"});
  while( r.next(list)){
      hipo::iterator it = hipo::iterator::reduce(list[0],"charge!=0");
      for(it.begin(); !it.end(); it.next()){
        printf("\t pid [%d] = %d\n",it.index(), list[0].getInt(0,it.index()));
      }
  }
```

Here is an example with lambda function:

```c++
  hipo::reader   r(file);
  hipo::banklist list = r.getBanks({"REC::Particle","REC::Event"});
  std::function charged = [](hipo::bank &b, int row) { return b.getInt("charge",row)!=0 ? 1.0 : 0.0;};

  while( r.next(list)){
    hipo::iterator it = hipo::iterator::reduce(list[0],charged);
    for(it.begin(); !it.end(); it.next()){
      printf("\t pid [%d] = %d\n",it.index(), list[0].getInt(0,it.index()));
    }
  }
```

Iterators can be used also to get indicies of the refernce bank. For example:

```c++
  hipo::reader   r(file);
  hipo::banklist list = r.getBanks({"REC::Particle","REC::Calorimeter"});

  while( r.next(list)){
    int status = list[0].getInt("status",0);
    if(list[0].getInt(0,0)==11&&abs(status)>=2000&&abs(status)<3000){
      hipo::iterator it = hipo::iterator::link(list[1],0,1);
      double energy = 0.0;
      for(it.begin(); !it.end(); it.next()){
        energy += list[1].getFloat("energy",it.index());
      }
      printf("total energy = %f\n",energy);
    }
  }
```

In the example above, the link function will return an iterator for the bank "REC::Calorimeter"
where the column number 1 (which is "pindex") has a value of 0. Then by itarating over the returned
indicies the total energy can be calculated.

## Analysis

A simple analysis package (include file only) is included in the hipo package for
constructing and showing physics quantitlies, the package includes physics vectors
(vector3 - 3 component vector class, and lorentz4 - lorentz vector) and a simple
reaction class that provides access to particles in the CLAS12 standard particle
bank and has methods to do physics vector calculations with simplified syntax.
The reaction package, combined with the histogrmamming package, can provide
neccessary tools for debugging and simple analysis from hipo files.
Here are tow exmaples of usage:

1) read file and construct missing mass of e-, pi+ and pi-, fill the histogram and print onthe screen.

```c++
#include "reader.h"
#include "twig.h"
#include "reaction.h"

int main(){
  std::string file = "mydatafile.hipo";
  // open a file, initialize internal beam vector to 10.6 gev.
  // and set event filter to:
  // 11 (electron) at least 1, 211 - (pi+) at least 1,
  // -211 (pi-) at least one
  fizika::reaction r(file,10.6,{{11,1},{211,1},{-211,1}});

  twig::h1d  hmx(120,0.5,2.8); // declare a 1D histogram
  while(r.next()){ // loop through file
    if(r.is_valid()){ // if the condition of 11:1 , 211:1 and -211:1 is met
      // get vector center mass (beam + target, where beam energy is passed through constructor
      // ,and target is considered a proton, can be changed) and subtruct the combined vector
      // of electron (11) , pi+ (211) and pi- (-211).
      // the arguments of {1,211,0,0.13957} are the following:
      // 1 - with positive sign ( use -1 if you want to subtract the vector)
      // 211 - the pid in particle pank (pi+ in this case)
      // 0 - how many pi+ to skip (0 means give me the first pi+ found)
      // 0.13957 - is the mass to assign to the lorentz vector when doing the math
      // the all three vectors passed to the get(...) function are added together
      // with the sign that is the first argument of the request string.
      fizika::lorentz4 vmx = r.cm() - r.get({ {1,11,0,0.0005}, {1,211,0,0.13957},{1,-211,0,0.13957}});
      
      hmx.fill(vmx.m()); // fill the histogram
    }
  } 
  hmx.print(); // print the histogram in the terminal
}
```

2) read the file and construct the invariant mass of two pions:

```c++
#include "reader.h"
#include "twig.h"
#include "reaction.h"

int main(){
  std::string file = "mydatafile.hipo";
  // open a file, initialize internal beam vector to 10.6 gev.
  // and set event filter to:
  // 11 (electron) at least 1, 22 - (photon) at least 2,
  fizika::reaction r(file,10.6,{{11,1},{22,2}}); 
  twig::h1d  hpi0(120,0.05,0.45); // declare a 1D histogram
  while(r.next()){ // loop through the file
    if(r.is_valid()){ // if the condition 11:1 and 22:2 is met
      // add vectors of first and second photons and return the result
      fizika::lorentz4 vgg =  r.get({ {1,22,0,0.0}, {1,22,1,0.0}});
      hpi0.fill(vgg.m()); //
    }
  } 
  hpi0.print();
}
```

## Package Structure

hipo4 directory contains sources and include files for version 4 of hipo.
Several examples are included (in the exmaples folder) for writing a simple
file with declared dictionary and a reader to read and display information
in the banks for each event.

## Python Interface

In modern evolving world of Artificial Intelligence there is a need for reading
HIPO files from Python. There is a python interface included in the package
(in directory python) implemented using ctypes that provides direct access to
the hipo4 shared library. No external dependencies and no compilation required.
Just provide the directory location where the lz4 and hipo4 shared libraries can
be found and use it.
For this example to work, compile the main directory producing the shared libraries.
The go to examples directory and compile, then run the writeFile.exe code, which
produces a file with a name "example_output.hipo". Here is an eaxmple of how to
read a file produced by the example code writeFile.cpp (in examples directory):


``` python
 # example of reading hipo file from python
 from hipolib import hreader

 filename = '../../examples/example_output.hipo'
 # the directory with shared libraries provided
 reader = hreader('../../slib')
 reader.open(filename)
 # define banks that will be read with each next() call
 reader.define('event::particle')
 counter = 0

 while(reader.next()==True):
     size = reader.getSize('event::particle')
     print('bank size = ',size)
     # get each column as an array from the bank
     array_px  = reader.getEntry('event::particle','px')
     array_pid = reader.getEntry('event::particle','pid')
     print('pid = ',array_pid)
     print('px  = ',array_px)    
     counter = counter + 1

 print('processed event # ', counter)
```

The output will look something lie this:

``` bash
bank size =  2
pid =  [7, 5]
